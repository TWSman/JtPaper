Dear Tomas, 
Thanks a lot first of all for your nice undertaking of paper writing. Please find my suggestions below. I'd like to address the result and discussion later. 
 
 Cheers,

 General comments
 1. Please use 
 \usepackage{units}
 all units can be used like this, for example, 5.02 TeV like \unit[5.02]{TeV}. This is to ensure a smaller space than normal between a value and unit.  TODO

 2. I don't know why but always I commented to use British English. So, you may be commented also. So, for instance, centre of mass, hadronisation and something else. 

 3. Please follow the ALICE policy for units and physical variable below, and I chopped useful tex commands also from the PDF. 
 So, jT,track should be $j_\mathrm{T,track}$. This is also true for plots.

 4. Don't forget to use correct units in histograms. For example, $p_\mathrm{T,.jet}$ (GeV/$c$).

  L42~48: we don't need to guide like Sec2, Sec3. You can omit those. The "Why pA" is the most important part of this paper. So this can be smoothly connected to the former context in L34-41.  TODO

  In p--Pb collisions the tracks are selected to satisfy the hybrid approach~\cite[24], which ensures a uniform distribution of tracks as a function of azimuthal angle (\varphi).  DONE
